## About me
I'm a third year engineering student at KTH university in Stockholm, studying a bachelor's degree in computer science. I dabble in video game development recreationally, but I'm particularly interested in all things cyber-sec. Besides being a tech geek I'm also incredibly fascinated by topics like sustainable gardening, permaculture, agroforestry, mushroom picking and net-zero emission architectures.
